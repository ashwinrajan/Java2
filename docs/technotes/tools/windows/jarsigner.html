<h1>jarsigner - JAR Signing and Verification Tool</h1>
<p>Generates signatures for Java ARchive (JAR) files, and verifies
the signatures of signed JAR files.</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre class="codeblock">
<strong>jarsigner</strong> [ <a href=
"#Options">options</a> ] jar-file alias
<strong>jarsigner</strong> -verify [ <a href=
"#Options">options</a> ] jar-file [alias...]
</pre>
<p>The jarsigner -verify command can take zero or more keystore
alias names after the jar filename. When specified, jarsigner will
check that the certificate used to verify each signed entry in the
jar file matches one of the keystore aliases. The aliases are
defined in the keystore specified by -keystore, or the default
keystore.</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The <b>jarsigner</b> tool is used for two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>to sign Java ARchive (JAR) files, and</li>
<li>to verify the signatures and integrity of signed JAR
files.</li>
</ol>
<p>The JAR feature enables the packaging of class files, images,
sounds, and other digital data in a single file for faster and
easier distribution. A tool named <a href="jar.html"><b>jar</b></a>
enables developers to produce JAR files. (Technically, any zip file
can also be considered a JAR file, although when created by
<b>jar</b> or processed by <b>jarsigner</b>, JAR files also contain
a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.)</p>
<p>A <i>digital signature</i> is a string of bits that is computed
from some data (the data being "signed") and the private key of an
entity (a person, company, etc.). Like a handwritten signature, a
digital signature has many useful characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its authenticity can be verified, via a computation that uses
the public key corresponding to the private key used to generate
the signature.</li>
<li>It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept
secret.</li>
<li>It is a function of the data signed and thus can't be claimed
to be the signature for other data as well.</li>
<li>The signed data cannot be changed; if it is, the signature will
no longer verify as being authentic.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for an entity's signature to be generated for a file,
the entity must first have a public/private key pair associated
with it, and also one or more certificates authenticating its
public key. A <i>certificate</i> is a digitally signed statement
from one entity, saying that the public key of some other entity
has a particular value.</p>
<p><b>jarsigner</b> uses key and certificate information from a
<i>keystore</i> to generate digital signatures for JAR files. A
keystore is a database of private keys and their associated X.509
certificate chains authenticating the corresponding public keys.
The <a href="keytool.html"><b>keytool</b></a> utility is used to
create and administer keystores.</p>
<p><b>jarsigner</b> uses an entity's private key to generate a
signature. The signed JAR file contains, among other things, a copy
of the certificate from the keystore for the public key
corresponding to the private key used to sign the file.
<b>jarsigner</b> can verify the digital signature of the signed JAR
file using the certificate inside it (in its signature block
file).</p>
<p><b>jarsigner</b> can generate signatures that include a
timestamp, thus enabling systems/deployer (including Java Plug-in)
to check whether the JAR file was signed while the signing
certificate was still valid. In addition, APIs will allow
applications to obtain the timestamp information.</p>
<p>At this time, <b>jarsigner</b> can only sign JAR files created
by the SDK <a href="jar.html"><b>jar</b></a> tool or zip files.
(JAR files are the same as zip files, except they also have a
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file. Such a file will automatically be
created when <b>jarsigner</b> signs a zip file.)</p>
<p>The default <b>jarsigner</b> behavior is to <i>sign</i> a JAR
(or zip) file. Use the <code>-verify</code> option to instead have
it <i>verify</i> a signed JAR file.</p>
<h3>Keystore Aliases</h3>
<p>All keystore entities are accessed via unique
<i>aliases</i>.</p>
<p>When using <b>jarsigner</b> to sign a JAR file, you must specify
the alias for the keystore entry containing the private key needed
to generate the signature. For example, the following will sign the
JAR file named "MyJARFile.jar", using the private key associated
with the alias "duke" in the keystore named "mystore" in the
"working" directory. Since no output file is specified, it
overwrites MyJARFile.jar with the signed JAR file.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -storepass <em>&lt;keystore password&gt;</em>
      -keypass <em>&lt;private key password&gt;</em> MyJARFile.jar duke
</pre>
<p>Keystores are protected with a password, so the store password must be specified. You will be prompted
for it if you don't specify it on the command line. Similarly,
private keys are protected in a keystore with a password, so the
private key's password must be
specified, and you will be prompted for it if you don't specify it
on the command line and it isn't the same as the store
password.</p>
<h3>Keystore Location</h3>
<p><b>jarsigner</b> has a <code>-keystore</code> option for
specifying the URL of the keystore to be used. The keystore is by
default stored in a file named <code>.keystore</code> in the user's
home directory, as determined by the <code>user.home</code> system
property. On Solaris systems <code>user.home</code> defaults to the
user's home directory.</p>
<p>Note that the input stream from the <code>-keystore</code>
option is passed to the <code>KeyStore.load</code> method. If
<code>NONE</code> is specified as the URL, then a null stream is
passed to the <code>KeyStore.load</code> method. <code>NONE</code>
should be specified if the <code>KeyStore</code> is not file-based,
for example, if it resides on a hardware token device.</p>
<h3><a name="KeystoreImplementation" id=
"KeystoreImplementation"></a>Keystore Implementation</h3>
<p>The <code>KeyStore</code> class provided in the
<code>java.security</code> package supplies well-defined interfaces
to access and modify the information in a keystore. It is possible
for there to be multiple different concrete implementations, where
each implementation is that for a particular <i>type</i> of
keystore.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two command-line tools that make use of
keystore implementations (<b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b>), and
also a GUI-based tool named <b>Policy Tool</b>. Since
<code>KeyStore</code> is publicly available, Java 2 SDK users can
write additional security applications that use it.</p>
<p>There is a built-in default implementation, provided by Sun
Microsystems. It implements the keystore as a file, utilizing a
proprietary keystore type (format) named "JKS". It protects each
private key with its individual password, and also protects the
integrity of the entire keystore with a (possibly different)
password.</p>
<p>Keystore implementations are provider-based. More specifically,
the application interfaces supplied by <code>KeyStore</code> are
implemented in terms of a "Service Provider Interface" (SPI). That
is, there is a corresponding abstract <code>KeystoreSpi</code>
class, also in the <code>java.security</code> package, which
defines the Service Provider Interface methods that "providers"
must implement. (The term "provider" refers to a package or a set
of packages that supply a concrete implementation of a subset of
services that can be accessed by the Java Security API.) Thus, to
provide a keystore implementation, clients must implement a
provider and supply a KeystoreSpi subclass implementation, as
described in <a href=
"../../guides/security/crypto/HowToImplAProvider.html">How to
Implement a Provider for the Java Cryptography
Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Applications can choose different <i>types</i> of keystore
implementations from different providers, using the "getInstance"
factory method supplied in the <code>KeyStore</code> class. A
keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore
information, and the algorithms used to protect private keys in the
keystore and the integrity of the keystore itself. Keystore
implementations of different types are not compatible.</p>
<p><b>keytool</b> works on any file-based keystore implementation.
(It treats the keystore location that is passed to it at the
command line as a filename and converts it to a FileInputStream,
from which it loads the keystore information.) The <b>jarsigner</b>
and <b>policytool</b> tools, on the other hand, can read a keystore
from any location that can be specified using a URL.</p>
<p>For <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>keytool</b>, you can specify a
keystore type at the command line, via the <i>-storetype</i>
option. For <b>Policy Tool</b>, you can specify a keystore type via
the "Change Keystore" command in the Edit menu.</p>
<p>If you don't explicitly specify a keystore type, the tools
choose a keystore implementation based simply on the value of the
<code>keystore.type</code> property specified in the security
properties file. The security properties file is called
<tt>java.security</tt>, and it resides in the SDK security
properties directory, <code><i>java.home</i>/lib/security</code>,
where <i>java.home</i> is the runtime environment's directory (the
<tt>jre</tt> directory in the SDK or the top-level directory of the
Java 2 Runtime Environment).</p>
<p>Each tool gets the <code>keystore.type</code> value and then
examines all the currently-installed providers until it finds one
that implements keystores of that type. It then uses the keystore
implementation from that provider.</p>
<p>The <code>KeyStore</code> class defines a static method named
<code>getDefaultType</code> that lets applications and applets
retrieve the value of the <code>keystore.type</code> property. The
following line of code creates an instance of the default keystore
type (as specified in the <code>keystore.type</code> property):</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
</pre>
<p>The default keystore type is "jks" (the proprietary type of the
keystore implementation provided by Sun). This is specified by the
following line in the security properties file:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    keystore.type=jks
</pre>
<p>Note: Case doesn't matter in keystore type designations. For
example, "JKS" would be considered the same as "jks".</p>
<p>To have the tools utilize a keystore implementation other than
the default, change that line to specify a different keystore type.
For example, if you have a provider package that supplies a
keystore implementation for a keystore type called "pkcs12", change
the line to</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    keystore.type=pkcs12
</pre>
<p>Note that if you us the PKCS#11 provider package, you should
refer to the <a href=
"../../guides/security/p11guide.html#KeyToolJarSigner">KeyTool and
JarSigner</a> section of the Java PKCS#11 Reference Guide for
details.</p>
<h3><a name="DefaultAlgs" id="DefaultAlgs">Supported
Algorithms</a></h3>
<p>By default, <b>jarsigner</b> signs a JAR file using one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) with the SHA1 digest
algorithm</li>
<li>RSA algorithm with the SHA256 digest algorithm.</li>
<li>EC (Elliptic Curve) cryptography algorithm with the SHA256 with
ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, if the signer's public and private keys are DSA keys,
<b>jarsigner</b> will sign the JAR file using the "SHA1withDSA"
algorithm. If the signer's keys are RSA keys, <b>jarsigner</b> will
attempt to sign the JAR file using the "SHA256withRSA" algorithm.
If the signer's keys are EC keys, <b>jarsigner</b> will sign the
JAR file using the "SHA256withECDSA" algorithm.</p>
<p>These default signature algorithms can be overridden using the
<i>-sigalg</i> option.</p>
<h3><a name="SignedJAR" id="SignedJAR"></a>The Signed JAR File</h3>
<p>When <b>jarsigner</b> is used to sign a JAR file, the output
signed JAR file is exactly the same as the input JAR file, except
that it has two additional files placed in the META-INF
directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>a signature file, with a .SF extension, and</li>
<li>a signature block file, with a .DSA, .RSA, or .EC
extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The base file names for these two files come from the value of
the <code>-sigFile</code> option. For example, if the option
appears as</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
-sigFile MKSIGN
</pre>
<p>The files are named "MKSIGN.SF" and "MKSIGN.DSA".</p>
<p>If no <code>-sigfile</code> option appears on the command line,
the base file name for the .SF and .DSA files will be the first 8
characters of the alias name specified on the command line, all
converted to upper case. If the alias name has fewer than 8
characters, the full alias name is used. If the alias name contains
any characters that are not allowed in a signature file name, each
such character is converted to an underscore ("_") character in
forming the file name. Legal characters include letters, digits,
underscores, and hyphens.</p>
<h4><a name="SFFile" id="SFFile"></a>The Signature (.SF) File</h4>
<p>A signature file (the .SF file) looks similar to the manifest
file that is always included in a JAR file when <b>jarsigner</b> is
used to sign the file. That is, for each source file included in
the JAR file, the .SF file has three lines, just as in the manifest
file, listing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file name,</li>
<li>the name of the digest algorithm used (SHA), and</li>
<li>a SHA digest value.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the manifest file, the SHA digest value for each source file
is the digest (hash) of the binary data in the source file. In the
.SF file, on the other hand, the digest value for a given source
file is the hash of the three lines in the manifest file for the
source file.</p>
<p>The signature file also, by default, includes a header
containing a hash of the whole manifest file. The presence of the
header enables verification optimization, as described in <a href=
"#Verifying">JAR File Verification</a>.</p>
<h4>The Signature Block File</h4>
The .SF file is signed and the signature is placed in the signature
block file. This file also contains, encoded inside it, the
certificate or certificate chain from the keystore which
authenticates the public key corresponding to the private key used
for signing. The file has the extension .DSA, .RSA, or .EC
depending on the digest algorithm used.
<h3><a name="Timestamp" id="Timestamp"></a>Signature Timestamp</h3>
<p><code>jarsigner</code> tool can generate and store a signature
timestamp when signing a JAR file. In addition,
<code>jarsigner</code> supports alternative signing mechanisms.
This behavior is optional and is controlled by the user at the time
of signing through these options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tsa"><code>-tsa url</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#tsacert"><code>-tsacert alias</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#altsigner"><code>-altsigner class</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#altsignerpath"><code>-altsignerpath
classpathlist</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these options is detailed in the <a href=
"#Options">Options</a> section below.</p>
<h3><a name="Verifying" id="Verifying"></a>JAR File
Verification</h3>
<p>A successful JAR file verification occurs if the signature(s)
are valid, and none of the files that were in the JAR file when the
signatures were generated have been changed since then. JAR file
verification involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify the signature of the .SF file itself.
<p>That is, the verification ensures that the signature stored in
each signature block (.DSA) file was in fact generated using the
private key corresponding to the public key whose certificate (or
certificate chain) also appears in the .DSA file. It also ensures
that the signature is a valid signature of the corresponding
signature (.SF) file, and thus the .SF file has not been tampered
with.</p>
</li>
<li>Verify the digest listed in each entry in the .SF file with
each corresponding section in the manifest.
<p>The .SF file by default includes a header containing a hash of
the entire manifest file. When the header is present, then the
verification can check to see whether or not the hash in the header
indeed matches the hash of the manifest file. If that is the case,
verification proceeds to the next step.</p>
<p>If that is not the case, a less optimized verification is
required to ensure that the hash in each source file information
section in the .SF file equals the hash of its corresponding
section in the manifest file (see <a href="#SFFile">The Signature
(.SF) File</a>).</p>
<p>One reason the hash of the manifest file that is stored in the
.SF file header may not equal the hash of the current manifest file
would be because one or more files were added to the JAR file
(using the <code>jar</code> tool) after the signature (and thus the
.SF file) was generated. When the <code>jar</code> tool is used to
add files, the manifest file is changed (sections are added to it
for the new files), but the .SF file is not. A verification is
still considered successful if none of the files that were in the
JAR file when the signature was generated have been changed since
then, which is the case if the hashes in the non-header sections of
the .SF file equal the hashes of the corresponding sections in the
manifest file.</p>
</li>
<li>Read each file in the JAR file that has an entry in the .SF
file. While reading, compute the file's digest, and then compare
the result with the digest for this file in the manifest section.
The digests should be the same, or verification fails.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any serious verification failures occur during the
verification process, the process is stopped and a security
exception is thrown. It is caught and displayed by
<b>jarsigner</b>.</p>
<h3>Multiple Signatures for a JAR File</h3>
<p>A JAR file can be signed by multiple people simply by running
the <b>jarsigner</b> tool on the file multiple times, specifying
the alias for a different person each time, as in:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  jarsigner myBundle.jar susan
  jarsigner myBundle.jar kevin
</pre>
<p>When a JAR file is signed multiple times, there are multiple .SF
and .DSA files in the resulting JAR file, one pair for each
signature. Thus, in the example above, the output JAR file includes
files with the following names:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  SUSAN.SF
  SUSAN.DSA
  KEVIN.SF
  KEVIN.DSA
</pre>
<p>Note: It is also possible for a JAR file to have mixed
signatures, some generated by the JDK 1.1 <b>javakey</b> tool and
others by <b>jarsigner</b>. That is, <b>jarsigner</b> can be used
to sign JAR files already previously signed using
<b>javakey</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="Options" id="Options"></a>OPTIONS</h2>
<p>The various <b>jarsigner</b> options are listed and described
below. Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>All option names are preceded by a minus sign (-).</li>
<li>The options may be provided in any order.</li>
<li>Items in italics (option values) represent the actual values
that must be supplied.</li>
<li>The <code>-keystore</code>, <code>-storepass</code>,
<code>-keypass</code>, <code>-sigfile</code>, <code>-sigalg</code>,
<code>-digestalg</code>, and <code>-signedjar</code> options are
only relevant when signing a JAR file, not when verifying a signed
JAR file. Similarly, an alias is only specified on the command line
when signing a JAR file.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>-keystore</code></b> <i>url</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the URL that tells the keystore location. This
defaults to the file <i>.keystore</i> in the user's home directory,
as determined by the "user.home" system property.
<p>A keystore is required when signing, so you must explicitly
specify one if the default keystore does not exist (or you want to
use one other than the default).</p>
<p>A keystore is <i>not</i> required when verifying, but if one is
specified, or the default exists, and the <code>-verbose</code>
option was also specified, additional information is output
regarding whether or not any of the certificates used to verify the
JAR file are contained in that keystore.</p>
<p>Note: the <code>-keystore</code> argument can actually be a file
name (and path) specification rather than a URL, in which case it
will be treated the same as a "file:" URL. That is,</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  -keystore <i>filePathAndName</i>
</pre>
<p>is treated as equivalent to</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  -keystore file:<i>filePathAndName</i>
</pre>
<p>If the Sun PKCS#11 provider has been configured in the
<tt>java.security</tt> security properties file (located in the
JRE's <tt>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security</tt> directory), then keytool and
jarsigner can operate on the PKCS#11 token by specifying these
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-keystore NONE</code></li>
<li><code>-storetype PKCS11</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, this command lists the contents of the configured
PKCS#11 token:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
   jarsigner -keystore NONE -storetype PKCS11 -list

</pre></dd>
<dt><b><code>-storetype</code></b> <i>storetype</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the type of keystore to be instantiated. The default
keystore type is the one that is specified as the value of the
"keystore.type" property in the security properties file, which is
returned by the static <code>getDefaultType</code> method in
<code>java.security.KeyStore</code>.
<p>The PIN for a PCKS#11 token can also be specified using the
<code>-storepass</code> option. If none has been specified, keytool
and jarsigner will prompt for the token PIN. If the token has a
protected authentication path (such as a dedicated PIN-pad or a
biometric reader), then the <tt>-protected</tt> option must be
specified and no password options can be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-storepass</code></b>[<code>:env</code> |
<code>:file</code>] <i>argument</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the password which is required to access the keystore.
This is only needed when signing (not verifying) a JAR file. In
that case, if a <code>-storepass</code> option is not provided at
the command line, the user is prompted for the password.</p>
<p>If the modifier <code>env</code> or <code>file</code> is not
specified, then the password has the value <i>argument</i>.
Otherwise, the password is retrieved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>env</code>: Retrieve the password from the environment
variable named <i>argument</i></li>
<li><code>file</code>: Retrieve the password from the file named
<i>argument</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The password shouldn't be specified on the command line or
in a script unless it is for testing purposes, or you are on a
secure system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-keypass</code></b>[<code>:env</code> |
<code>:file</code>] <i>argument</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the password used to protect the private key of the
keystore entry addressed by the alias specified on the command
line. The password is required when using <b>jarsigner</b> to sign
a JAR file. If no password is provided on the command line, and the
required password is different from the store password, the user is
prompted for it.</p>
<p>If the modifier <code>env</code> or <code>file</code> is not
specified, then the password has the value <i>argument</i>.
Otherwise, the password is retrieved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>env</code>: Retrieve the password from the environment
variable named <i>argument</i></li>
<li><code>file</code>: Retrieve the password from the file named
<i>argument</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The password shouldn't be specified on the command line or
in a script unless it is for testing purposes, or you are on a
secure system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-sigfile</code></b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the base file name to be used for the generated .SF
and .DSA files. For example, if <i>file</i> is "DUKESIGN", the
generated .SF and .DSA files will be named "DUKESIGN.SF" and
"DUKESIGN.DSA", and will be placed in the "META-INF" directory of
the signed JAR file.
<p>The characters in <i>file</i> must come from the set
"a-zA-Z0-9_-". That is, only letters, numbers, underscore, and
hyphen characters are allowed. Note: All lowercase characters will
be converted to uppercase for the .SF and .DSA file names.</p>
<p>If no <code>-sigfile</code> option appears on the command line,
the base file name for the .SF and .DSA files will be the first 8
characters of the alias name specified on the command line, all
converted to upper case. If the alias name has fewer than 8
characters, the full alias name is used. If the alias name contains
any characters that are not legal in a signature file name, each
such character is converted to an underscore ("_") character in
forming the file name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-sigalg</code></b> <i>algorithm</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the signature algorithm to use to sign
the JAR file.
<p>See <a href=
"../../guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#AppA">Appendix A</a>
of the Java Cryptography Architecture for a list of standard
signature algorithm names. This algorithm must be compatible with
the private key used to sign the JAR file. If this option is not
specified, SHA1withDSA, SHA256withRSA, or SHA256withECDSA will be
used depending on the type of private key. There must either be a
statically installed provider supplying an implementation of the
specified algorithm or the user must specify one with the
<i>-providerClass</i> option, otherwise the command will not
succeed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-digestalg</code></b> <i>algorithm</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the message digest algorithm to use when
digesting the entries of a jar file.
<p>See <a href=
"../../guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#AppA">Appendix A</a>
of the Java Cryptography Architecture for a list of standard
message digest algorithm names. If this option is not specified,
SHA256 will be used. There must either be a statically installed
provider supplying an implementation of the specified algorithm or
the user must specify one with the <i>-providerClass</i> option,
otherwise the command will not succeed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-signedjar</code></b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the name to be used for the signed JAR file.
<p>If no name is specified on the command line, the name used is
the same as the input JAR file name (the name of the JAR file to be
signed); in other words, that file is overwritten with the signed
JAR file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-verify</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this appears on the command line, the specified JAR file
will be verified, not signed. If the verification is successful,
"jar verified" will be displayed. If you try to verify an unsigned
JAR file, or a JAR file signed with an unsupported algorithm (e.g.,
RSA when you don't have an RSA provider installed), the following

<dt><b><code>-certs</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this appears on the command line, along with the
<code>-verify</code> and <code>-verbose</code> options, the output
includes certificate information for each signer of the JAR file.
This information includes
<ul>
<li>the name of the type of certificate (stored in the .DSA file)
that certifies the signer's public key</li>
<li>if the certificate is an X.509 certificate (more specifically,
an instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code>):
the distinguished name of the signer</li>
</ul>
<p>The keystore is also examined. If no keystore value is specified
on the command line, the default keystore file (if any) will be
checked. If the public key certificate for a signer matches an
entry in the keystore, then the following information will also be
displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>in parentheses, the alias name for the keystore entry for that
signer. If the signer actually comes from a JDK 1.1 identity
database instead of from a keystore, the alias name will appear in
brackets instead of parentheses.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-certchain</code></b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the certificate chain to be used, if the certificate
chain associated with the private key of the keystore entry,
addressed by the alias specified on the command line, is not
complete. This may happen if the keystore is located on a hardware
token where there is not enough capacity to hold a complete
certificate chain. The file can be a sequence of X.509 certificates
concatenated together, or a single PKCS#7 formatted data block,
either in binary encoding format or in printable encoding format
(also known as BASE64 encoding) as defined by the <a href=
"keytool.html#EncodeCertificate">Internet RFC 1421
standard</a>.</dd>
<dt><b><code>-verbose</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this appears on the command line, it indicates "verbose"
mode, which causes <b>jarsigner</b> to output extra information as
to the progress of the JAR signing or verification.</dd>
<dt><b><code>-internalsf</code></b></dt>
<dd>In the past, the .DSA (signature block) file generated when a
JAR file was signed used to include a complete encoded copy of the
.SF file (signature file) also generated. This behavior has been
changed. To reduce the overall size of the output JAR file, the
.DSA file by default doesn't contain a copy of the .SF file
anymore. But if <code>-internalsf</code> appears on the command
line, the old behavior is utilized. <b>This option is mainly useful
for testing; in practice, it should not be used, since doing so
eliminates a useful optimization.</b></dd>
<dt><b><code>-sectionsonly</code></b></dt>
<dd>If this appears on the command line, the .SF file (signature
file) generated when a JAR file is signed does <i>not</i> include a
header containing a hash of the whole manifest file. It just
contains information and hashes related to each individual source
file included in the JAR file, as described in <a href=
"#SFFile">The Signature (.SF) File</a> .
<p>By default, this header is added, as an optimization. When the
header is present, then whenever the JAR file is verified, the
verification can first check to see whether or not the hash in the
header indeed matches the hash of the whole manifest file. If so,
verification proceeds to the next step. If not, it is necessary to
do a less optimized verification that the hash in each source file
information section in the .SF file equals the hash of its
corresponding section in the manifest file.</p>
<p>For further information, see <a href="#Verifying">JAR File
Verification</a>.</p>
<p><b>This option is mainly useful for testing; in practice, it

</dd>
<dt><code><b>-protected</b></code></dt>
<dd>Either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This value
should be specified as <code>true</code> if a password must be
given via a protected authentication path such as a dedicated PIN
reader.</dd>
<dt><b><code>-providerClass</code></b>
<i>provider-class-name</i></dt>
<dd>Used to specify the name of cryptographic service provider's
master class file when the service provider is not listed in the
security properties file, <tt>java.security</tt>.
<p>Used in conjunction with the <code>-providerArg</code>
<i>ConfigFilePath</i> option, keytool and jarsigner will install
the provider dynamically (where <i>ConfigFilePath</i> is the path
to the token configuration file). Here's an example of a command to
list a PKCS#11 keystore when the Sun PKCS#11 provider has not been
configured in the security properties file.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
jarsigner -keystore NONE -storetype PKCS11 \
          -providerClass sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 \
          -providerArg /foo/bar/token.config \
          -list
</pre></dd>
<dt><b><code>-providerName</code></b> <i>providerName</i></dt>
<dd>If more than one provider has been configured in the
<tt>java.security</tt> security properties file, you can use the
<tt>-providerName</tt> option to target a specific provider
instance. The argument to this option is the name of the provider.
<p>For the Sun PKCS#11 provider, <i>providerName</i> is of the form
<tt>SunPKCS11-<i>TokenName</i></tt>, where
<tt><i>TokenName</i></tt> is the name suffix that the provider
instance has been configured with, as detailed in the <a href=
"../../guides/security/p11guide.html#ATTRS">configuration
attributes table</a>. For example, the following command lists the
contents of the PKCS#11 keystore provider instance with name suffix
<tt>SmartCard</tt>:</p>

around the interpreter.) This option should not contain any spaces.
It is useful for adjusting the execution environment or memory
usage. For a list of possible interpreter options, type <code>java
-h</code> or <code>java -X</code> at the command line.

<dt><b><code>-tsa</code></b> <i>url</i></dt>
<dd>If <code>"-tsa http://example.tsa.url"</code> appears on the

identifies the location of the Time Stamping Authority (TSA). It
overrides any URL found via the <code>-tsacert</code> option. The
<code>-tsa</code> option does not require the TSA's public key
certificate to be present in the keystore.
<p>To generate the timestamp, <code>jarsigner</code> communicates
with the TSA using the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) defined in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt">RFC 3161</a>. If
successful, the timestamp token returned by the TSA is stored along
with the signature in the signature block file.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><code>-tsacert</code></b> <i>alias</i></dt>
<dd>If <code>"-tsacert alias"</code> appears on the command line
when signing a JAR file then a timestamp is generated for the
signature. The <code>alias</code> identifies the TSA's public key
certificate in the keystore that is currently in effect. The
entry's certificate is examined for a Subject Information Access
extension that contains a URL identifying the location of the TSA.
<p>The TSA's public key certificate must be present in the keystore
when using <code>-tsacert</code>.</p>
<p><a name="altsigner" id="altsigner"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt><b><code>-altsigner</code></b> <i>class</i></dt>

path to this class file is defined by the
<code>-altsignerpath</code> option. If the <code>-altsigner</code>
option is used, <code>jarsigner</code> uses the signing mechanism
provided by the specified class. Otherwise, <code>jarsigner</code>
uses its default signing mechanism.
<p>For example, to use the signing mechanism provided by a class
named <code>com.sun.sun.jarsigner.AuthSigner</code>, use the

<dt><b><code>-altsignerpath</code></b> <i>classpathlist</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the path to the class file (the class file name is
specified with the <code>-altsigner</code> option described above)
and any JAR files it depends on. If the class file is in a JAR
file, then this specifies the path to that JAR file, as shown in
the example below.
<p>An absolute path or a path relative to the current directory may
be specified. If <code>classpathlist</code> contains multiple paths

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<h3>Signing a JAR File</h3>
<p>Suppose you have a JAR file named "bundle.jar" and you'd like to
sign it using the private key of the user whose keystore alias is
"jane" in the keystore named "mystore" in the "working" directory.
You can use the following
to sign the JAR file and name the signed JAR file
"sbundle.jar":</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -storepass <em>&lt;keystore password&gt;</em>
      -keypass <em>&lt;private key password&gt;</em> -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane
</pre>
<p>Note that there is no <code>-sigfile</code> specified in the
command above, so the generated .SF and .DSA files to be placed in
the signed JAR file will have default names based on the alias
name. That is, they will be named <code>JANE.SF</code> and
<code>JANE.DSA</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to be prompted for the store password and the
private key password, you could shorten the above command to</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore
      -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane
</pre>
<p>If the keystore to be used is the default keystore (the one
named ".keystore" in your home directory), you don't need to
specify a keystore, as in:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane
</pre>
<p>Finally, if you want the signed JAR file to simply overwrite the
input JAR file (<code>bundle.jar</code>), you don't need to specify
a <code>-signedjar</code> option:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner bundle.jar jane
</pre>
<h3>Verifying a Signed JAR File</h3>
<p>To verify a signed JAR file, that is, to verify that the
signature is valid and the JAR file has not been tampered with, use
a command such as the following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -verify sbundle.jar
</pre>
<p>If the verification is successful,</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jar verified.
</pre>
<p>is displayed. Otherwise, an error message appears.</p>
<p>You can get more information if you use the
<code>-verbose</code> option. A sample use of <b>jarsigner</b> with
the <code>-verbose</code> option is shown below, along with sample
output:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -verify -verbose sbundle.jar

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore

    jar verified.
</pre>
<h3>Verification with Certificate Information</h3>
<p>If you specify the <code>-certs</code> option when verifying,
along with the <code>-verify</code> and <code>-verbose</code>
options, the output includes certificate information for each
signer of the JAR file, including the certificate type, the signer
distinguished name information (if and only if it's an X.509
certificate), and, in parentheses, the keystore alias for the
signer if the public key certificate in the JAR file matches that
in a keystore entry. For example,</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -verify -verbose -certs myTest.jar

           198 Fri Sep 26 16:14:06 PDT 1997 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore

    jar verified.
</pre>
<p>If the certificate for a signer is not an X.509 certificate,
there is no distinguished name information. In that case, just the
certificate type and the alias are shown. For example, if the
certificate is a PGP certificate, and the alias is "bob", you'd
get</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
      PGP, (bob)
</pre>
<h3>Verification of a JAR File that Includes Identity Database
Signers</h3>
<p>If a JAR file has been signed using the JDK 1.1 <b>javakey</b>
tool, and thus the signer is an alias in an identity database, the
verification output includes an "i" symbol. If the JAR file has
been signed by both an alias in an identity database and an alias
in a keystore, both "k" and "i" appear.</p>
<p>When the <code>-certs</code> option is used, any identity
database aliases are shown in square brackets rather than the
parentheses used for keystore aliases. For example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -verify -verbose -certs writeFile.jar

           198 Fri Sep 26 16:14:06 PDT 1997 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

      X.509, CN=Duke, OU=Java Software, O=Sun, L=cup, S=ca, C=us [duke]

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore
      i = at least one certificate was found in identity scope

    jar verified.
</pre>
<p>Note that the alias "duke" is in brackets to denote that it is
an identity database alias, not a keystore alias.</p>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
During the signing/verifying process, jarsigner may display various
warnings. These warning codes are defined as follows:
<pre class="codeblock">
         hasExpiringCert         2
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate will expire within six months

         hasExpiredCert          4
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate has expired.

         notYetValidCert         4
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate is not yet valid.

         chainNotValidated       4
             This jar contains entries whose certificate chain cannot be correctly validated.

         badKeyUsage             8
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate's KeyUsage extension doesn't allow code signing.

         badExtendedKeyUsage     8
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate's ExtendedKeyUsage extension
             doesn't allow code signing.

         badNetscapeCertType     8
             This jar contains entries whose signer certificate's NetscapeCertType extension
             doesn't allow code signing.

         hasUnsignedEntry        16
             This jar contains unsigned entries which have not been integrity-checked.

         notSignedByAlias        32
             This jar contains signed entries which are not signed by the specified alias(es)

         aliasNotInStore         32
             This jar contains signed entries that are not signed by alias in this keystore

</pre>
<p>When the <code>-strict</code> option is provided, an OR-value of
warnings detected will be returned as the exit code of the tool.
For example, if a certificate used to sign an entry is expired and
has a keyUsage extension that does not allow it to sign a file, an
exit code 12 (=4+8) will be returned.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Exit codes are reused because only 0-255 is legal
for Unix. In any case, if the signing/verifying process fails, the
following exit code will be returned:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
failure                 1
</pre>
<h3>Compatibility with JDK 1.1</h3>
<p>The <b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b> tools completely replace
the <b>javakey</b> tool provided in JDK 1.1. These new tools
provide more features than <b>javakey</b>, including the ability to
protect the keystore and private keys with passwords, and the
ability to verify signatures in addition to generating them.</p>
<p>The new keystore architecture replaces the identity database
that <b>javakey</b> created and managed. There is no backwards
compatibility between the keystore format and the database format
used by <b>javakey</b> in 1.1. However,</p>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to import the information from an identity
database into a keystore, via the <b>keytool</b>
<code>-identitydb</code> command.</li>
<li><b>jarsigner</b> can sign JAR files also previously signed
using <b>javakey</b>.</li>
<li><b>jarsigner</b> can verify JAR files signed using
<b>javakey</b>. Thus, it recognizes and can work with signer
aliases that are from a JDK 1.1 identity database rather than a
Java 2 SDK keystore.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table explains how JAR files that were signed in
JDK 1.1.x are treated in the Java 2 platform.</p>
