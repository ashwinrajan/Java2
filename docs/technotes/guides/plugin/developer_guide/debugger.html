<p>The purpose of this document is to simplify the debugging of
applets. It provides techniques and suggestions for developing
applets in Java Plug-in and describes some common errors
encountered in applet development.</p>
<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Debug Applets in Java
Plug-in</h2>
<p>Applets should be debugged using the java debugger utility
<a href="../../jpda/jdb.html">jdb</a>. &nbsp; Also make sure to
compile your .java files with -g option with javac. To begin
debugging your applet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Java Control Panel. Click&nbsp; <strong>Java &gt;
View</strong>. Specify the following parameters in the <strong>Java
Runtime Parameters</strong> with each parameter separated by a
comma as follows:
<pre>
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_shmem,address=jdbconn,server=y,suspend=n  
</pre>
<p>See <a href="../../jpda/conninv.html">JPDA Connection and
Invocation</a> for the details on the possible runtime parameters
for debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>Start Internet Explorer or Mozilla browser and load the page
which contains the applet to be debugged. Make sure the applet code
has been compiled with -g option of javac.</li>
<li>Run the command jdb -attach &lt;<em>address</em>&gt; in a DOS
command prompt. &lt;<em>address</em>&gt; is the name mentioned in
the step. For example, if &lt;<em>address</em>&gt; is jdbconn, you
will run the command as
<pre>
                 jdb -attach jdbconn 
</pre>
To learn more about the Java Debugger (jdb), see <a href=
"../../../tools/windows/jdb.html">The Java Debugger</a>.</li>
<li>Once the jdb is attached to the VM, you can set up breakpoints
in the applet.</li>
<li>When the applet in the browser reaches the breakpoint, it will
stop executing, and you will see the debugger waiting for your
input to continue debugging.</li>
</ol>
<p>When debugging applets in Java Plug-in, make sure that only one
instance of the browser is being used for debugging using the same
connection address at the same time. Otherwise, it will result in a
conflict, since the Java Runtime for each instance of the browser
will try to gain exclusive access to the connection address. To
debug applets in both Internet Explorer and supported Mozilla
browsers, run either Internet Explorer or supported Mozilla
browsers with Java Plug-in&mdash;but not both at the same time.</p>
<p>Debugging applets in Java Plug-in with Active Desktop is
discouraged because an instance of Internet Explorer will always be
running in the desktop process during the lifetime of the user
session.</p>
<p>You can use other debuggers from IDEs like Borlands JBuilder or
Symantec's VisualCafe, instead of jdb. To use these debuggers, you
will need to change the project option in these IDEs to
<em>attach</em> Java Plug-in in the browser process on the same
machine or remote machine. Different Java Runtime Parameters may
also be required in the Java Control Panel. For more information,
refer Java debugger or IDE manuals.</p>
<h2><a name="jpic" id="jpic"></a>Java Console</h2>
<p>Java Console is a simple console window for redirecting all the
<code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> messages. The
console window is disabled by default. It can be enabled from the
Java Control Panel or the task bar. If the console is enabled, you
will see the console window appear when Java Plug-in is used in the
browser. For more information on Java Console see Java Console
documentation.</p>
<p>For information on Java Console see the <a href=
"console.html">Java Console</a> section of the <a href=
"../../deployment/index.html">Deployment Guide</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="jpitf" id="jpitf"></a>Java Plug-in Trace File</h2>
<p>The Java Plug-in trace file records all the debug, System.out,
and System.err messages. The trace file is disabled by default but
is automatically enabled when the Java Console is enabled.&nbsp;
The trace file is located by default at&nbsp; <code>C:\Documents
and Settings\&lt;<em>username</em>&gt;\Application
Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\log</code> in the <code>user.dir</code>.
The trace file has the naming convention
<code>.plugin&lt;<em>version</em>&gt;.trace</code> where
&lt;version&gt; indicates the version of Java installed on the
system.</p>
<p>The <code>user.dir</code> directory contains various log and
trace files. In Windows 2000 and Windows XP this file is located at
the following location:<br />
<code>C:\Documents and
Settings\&lt;<em>username</em>&gt;\Application
Data\Sun\Java\Deployment.</code></p>
<p>The Application Data folder and its contents are hidden by
default in Windows.</p>
<h2><a name="jpitp" id="jpitp"></a><code>javaplugin.trace</code>
property</h2>
<p>This property controls whether Java Plug-in prints its trace
messages during execution. This is useful to applet developers to
determine what is occuring within Java Plug-in. To enable tracing
follow the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Java Control Panel</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>&gt;
Debugging</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Enable Tracing</strong> checkbox .</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="jsdp" id="jsdp"></a><code>java.security.debug</code>
property</h2>
<p>This property controls whether the security system of the Java
Runtime Environment prints its trace messages during execution.
This is usful when a security exception is thrown in an applet or
when a signed applet is not working. The following options are
supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>access</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;— print all
<code>checkPermission</code> results</li>
<li><code>jar</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— print jar
verification information</li>
<li><code>policy</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;— print policy information</li>
<li><code>scl</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— print permissions
<code>SecureClassLoader</code> assigns</li>
</ul>
<p>The following options can be used with
<i><code>access</code></i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>stack</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— include stack
trace</li>
<li><code>domain</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;— dumps all domains in
context</li>
<li><code>failure</code> — before throwing exception, dump the
stack and domain that didn't have permission</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to print all <code>checkPermission</code> results
and dump all domains in context, perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Java Control Panel</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Java &gt; View</strong>. The <strong>Java Runtime
Settings</strong> dialog box is displayed.</li>
<li>Type <code>-Djava.security.debug=access:stack</code> in the
<strong>Java Runtime Parameters</strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="online" id="online"></a>Documentation</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in provides a rich set of documentation to help
developers use the various features of Java Plug-in. The
documentation includes a <a href="faq/index.html">FAQ</a>, which
includes some of the most frequently asked questions by developers.
Make sure you read and understand these documents before applet
development, as it may save you hundreds of hours in debugging.</p>
<h2><a name="isolating" id="isolating"></a>Isolating Bugs</h2>
<p>Although Java Plug-in provides the Java 2 Runtime Environment
within Internet Explorer and supported Mozilla browsers, most of
the facilities are provided by the Java 2 Runtime itself, rather
than by Java Plug-in. Therefore, if a problem occurs in Java
Plug-in, it may be either a problem in Java Plug-in, the Java 2
Runtime itself or a user error. It is extremely important to
determine where bugs originate, as it will affect the speed of bug
evaluation and fixing. Here are some suggestions for isolating
bugs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the applets in both Internet Explorer and supported Mozilla
browsers through Java Plug-in.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Run the applets in <code>appletviewer</code>. Java Plug-in is
mainly derived from <code>appletviewer</code> and has inherited
problems from <code>appletviewer</code> as well. This step should
be performed only if the applet doesn't require specific browser
facilities that Java Plug-in provides, like HTTPS or RSA
signing.</li>
<li>If the applet fails in <code>appletviewer</code>, it is likely
the problem is in the Java 2 Runtime Environment—and not in Java
Plug-in.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the applet fails in only one of the browsers, IE or
supported Mozilla browsers, it is likely a Java Plug-in
problem.</li>
<li>If the applet fails in both browsers but not
<code>appletviewer</code>, it could be either a Java Plug-in
problem or user error. Please examine the applet code to see if it
makes any assumptions about the execution environment. For example,
in <code>appletviewer</code> the current directory is set to the
current directory in the shell when <code>appletviewer</code> is
launched, whereas the current directory in Java Plug-in may be set
to the browser's directory. Therefore, loading resources from the
current directory may work in <code>appletviewer</code> but not in
Java Plug-in.</li>
<li>Try to reproduce the problem on other machines or platforms. In
some cases, the root of the problem may be in the machine
configuration, e.g., an improper DNS setup.</li>
<li>If you have identified the problems in the Java 2 Runtime
Environment or Java Plug-in, please follow the instructions in the
next section to submit a bug report to the appropriate product
categories.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="submitting-br" id="submitting-br"></a>Submitting Bug
Reports</h2>
<p>To submit a bug report, go to the Java Development Connection's
<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/">Bug Database</a> . Before submitting
a bug, search the Bug Database to determine if the bug has already
been reported. In some cases, a workaround may also have been
suggested. If the bug is not already reported, submit a new bug
report to the Java Plug-in team. In the bug report, include the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete description of the problem and step-by-step
instructions for reproducing it;</li>
<li>Error messages captured by Java Console or trace file;</li>
<li>Proxy configuration information, e.g., auto proxy configuration
with proxy configuration file attached;</li>
<li>Browser and platform information, e.g., supported Mozilla
browsers on Win 2000;</li>
<li>A test case demonstrating the problem;</li>
<li>Specify whether the problem occurs in other browsers and
<code>appletviewer</code>;</li>
<li>Specify any workaround available;</li>
<li>Specify personal information—your name and email address—so you
may be contacted if additional information is required.</li>
