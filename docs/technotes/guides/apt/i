<code>apt</code> is a command-line utility for annotation processing.
It includes a set of reflective APIs and supporting infrastructure to 
process program 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175">annotations</a>.  
These reflective APIs provide a build-time, source-based,
read-only view of program structure.  They are designed to cleanly model 
the Java<sup><small>TM</small></sup>
programming language's type system after the addition of <a

<code>apt</code> first runs annotation processors that can produce new
source code and other files.  Next, <code>apt</code> can cause
compilation of both original and generated source files, thus
easing the development cycle.
