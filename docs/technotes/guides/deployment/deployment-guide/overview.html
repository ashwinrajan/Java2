<h1>Java&trade; Deployment Overview</h1>
<p align="left"><b>Note:</b> This Java deployment guide describes
features release d prior to Java SE 6u10.</p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="../../jweb/deployment_advice.html">Java Rich
Internet Applications Deployment Advice</a> document for deployment
changes introduced in Java SE 6u10.</li>
<li>See <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/jre/jre_install.html">
Java Runtime Environment Installation</a> document for information
on the new Java Kernel installer, Java Runtime Environment
installation and update.&lt;/ li&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>There are two types of deployment technologies available in
Java&trade; Standard Edition (Java SE) for deploying client-side
Java applications on the desktop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Java Plug-in<br />
<br />
Java Plug-in is a tool used for deploying Java applets that run
inside a web browser.&nbsp;Supported web browsers include Internet
Explorer, Mozilla, and Netscape Navigator. For more information,
see <a href="../../plugin/developer_guide/contents.html">Java
Plug-in Developer Guide</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Java Web Start<br />
<br />
Java Web Start is a tool used for deploying standalone Java
applications on the desktop, using JNLP (Java Network Launching
Protocol). For more information, see <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java Web Start
Developer Guide</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many similar deployment features between Java Plug-in and Java
Web Start have been consolidated. The focus of this guide is to
outline common deployment features and general deployment practices
for both products.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation of
the Java Platform</h2>
<p>To deploy a Java applet or application, one must first decide
how to deploy the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) . The JRE is
available in many install formats for download and manual install.
An <a href="autodownload.html">automatic download</a> and install
is available for deploying JRE and applications through the
browsers on Windows. Enterprise developers or ISVs who would like
the JRE to install silently, can use the <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javase/7/webnotes/install/jre/silent.html">silent
installation</a> option in the installer. For developers and ISVs
deploying the Java Platform in Windows-only environments, they
should also check out the <a href="install-msi.html">Active
Directory deployment</a> option in the installer.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="writing" id="writing"></a>Writing Java applets and
applications</h2>
<p>Applets and applications written in the Java Programming
language are the main target for deployment. Java Platform,
Standard Edition, v 6 API Specification provides the means, along
with various compilers and debuggers, to develop applets and
applications in the Java Programming language. See <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/">Java(TM) Platform,
Standard Edition, v 6 API Specification</a>.</p>
<p>If you are migrating applets from Microsoft VM to Sun's Java
Virtual Machine, please check out <a href=
"applet-compatibility.html">Applet Compatibility</a>, <a href=
"upgrade-guide/index.html">Java Upgrade Guide</a> and <a href=
"repository.html">System-Wide Repository</a> for tips on the
migration.</p>
<h2><br />
<a name="authoring" id="authoring"></a>Deploying Java applets and
applications</h2>
<p>To deploy applets and applications over the Internet, it is
necessary to specify the applets and applications on the web page
for download and launch.</p>
<p>For an applet in a web page displayed in a browser using Sun's
JVM, the applet must be embedded in the page with the required
tagging structure for Java Plug-in. For topics related to Java
Plug-in, see the <a href=
"../../plugin/developer_guide/contents.html">Java Plug-in Developer
Guide</a>.</p>
<p>To seamlessly download, cache, and launch an applications from a
web page, such a page will need to contain a link to a special Java
Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file on a web server. Java Web
Start, which comes with the JRE, will then be able to download,
cache, and launch the application. For topics related to JNLP and
Java Web Start, see the <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java Web Start
Developer Guide</a>.</p>
<h2><br />
<a name="networking" id="networking"></a>Networking in Java
Deployment</h2>
<p>Both Java Plug-in and Java Web Start support the deployment of
applets and applications over many types of network protocols (e.g.
HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOCKS) and many types of security authentication
(HTTP Basic, Digest, NTLM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For deployment of the applets and applications behind a proxy
server, Java Plug-in and Java Web Start also provide complete proxy
support for various configurations from the browser as well as from
the Java Control Panel. See <a href="proxie_config.html">Proxy
Configuration</a>.</p>
<p>For applets and applications deployed from servers or connecting
to servers, Java Plug-in and Java Web Start also provide complete
cookie support as a way for servers to store data on the client
side. See <a href="cookie_support.html">Cookie</a>.</p>
<p>Although Java Archive (JAR) is the de facto way to package
applets and applications, it is not always the most efficient for
network download. Two new compression formats are available for
deploying Java applets and applications in Java Plug-in and Java
Web Start: gzip and Pack200. See <a href="pack200.html">Pack200 and
Compression</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="setting" id="setting"></a>Security in Java
Deployment</h2>
<p>By default, Java applets and applications deployed using Java
Plug-in and Java Web Start are run in a secure sandbox which
defines the set of permissions granted to an untrusted application.
See <a href="security.html">Security</a>.</p>
<p>With JAR signing, Java applets and applications deployed using
Java Plug-in and Java Web Start are allowed to run outside the
sandbox with additional permissions, if the users grant the
permissions to the trusted application. See <a href=
"../../../tools/windows/jarsigner.html">jarsigner</a> on how to
properly sign an application for deployment.</p>
<p>To ensure the signed applets and applications will continue to
work after deployment even if the certificate has expired,
deployers should consider signature timestamp signing. This is
fully supported by Java Plug-in and Java Web Start. See <a href=
"../../security/time-of-signing.html">Signature Timestamp</a>.</p>
<p>During signature verification and HTTPS server/client
authentication, certificates and keys in the default Java keystore
are used by Java Plug-in and Java Web Start. In addition, Java
Plug-in and Java Web Start also support certificates and keys in
the browser and on the smart card for various purposes. See
<a href="keystores.html">Browser Keystores</a>.</p>
<h2><br />
<a name="configuration" id="configuration"></a>Configuration in
Java Deployment</h2>
<p>Under the cover of Java Plug-in and Java Web Start, many aspects
of the deployment environment, including security access controls,
networking configuration, certificate stores, etc., are
configurable through deployment configuration properties.</p>
<p>For developers who would like to customize the deployment
environment, the deployment configuration file can be used for
customization.</p>
<p>For enterprise developers or ISVs who would like to centrally
deploy a configuration to tens of thousands of systems, they can
also leverage the enterprise configuration support that is
built-into the deployment configuration infrastructure in Java
Plug-in and Java Web Start. See <a href=
"properties.html">Deployment Configuration File and Properties</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>For developers or end users who would like to customize a user
specific deployment environment in a user-friendly manner, Java
Control Panel is a tool that can be used to serve this purpose. See
<a href="jcp.html">Java Control Panel</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="debugging" id="debugging"></a>Debugging in Java
Deployment</h2>
<p>Debugging Java applets and applications is often done through
Java IDEs or Java debuggers. In addition, Java Plug-in and Java Web
Start have several built-in facilities that make debugging easier,
including <a href="console.html">Java Console</a>, and <a href=
"tracing_logging.html">Tracing and Logging</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="updating" id="updating"></a>Updating the Java
Platform</h2>
<p>Java Update is a solution for keeping the Java platform
up-to-date automatically with latest updates on end users'
supported Windows platform. Java Update is bundled with the JRE, so
every system with a JRE installed is also Java Update enabled by
default. Java Update keeps most systems up-to-date with latest
versions of the JRE.&nbsp; Therefore, developers are encouraged to
take advantage of the latest JRE features for development, without
worrying too much on deploying the latest JRE on their customers
systems. For more information, see <a href="java-update.html">Java
Update</a>.<br />
