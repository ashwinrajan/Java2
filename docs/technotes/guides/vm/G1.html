<h1>Garbage-First Collector</h1>
<hr size="3" noshade="noshade" />
<h2>What is the Garbage-First Collector?</h2>
<p>Garbage-First (G1) Collector is a server-style garbage
collector, targeted for multi-processors with large memories, that
meets a soft real-time goal with high probability, while achieving
high throughput. G1 is the long term replacement of the Concurrent
Mark-Sweep Collector (CMS). Whole-heap operations, such as global
marking, are performed concurrently with the application threads,
to prevent interruptions proportional to heap or live-data size.
Concurrent marking provides both collection "completeness" and
identifies regions ripe for reclamation via compacting evacuation.
This evacuation is performed in parallel on multi-processors, to
decrease pause times and increase throughput.</p>
<p>The G1 collector achieves these goals through several
techniques. The heap is partitioned into a set of equal-sized heap
regions, each a contiguous range of virtual memory. G1 compacts as
it proceeds. It copies objects from one area of the heap to the
other. Thus, it will not encounter fragmentation issues that CMS
might encounter. There will always be areas of contiguous free
space from which to allocate, allowing G1 to have consistent pauses
over time. G1 uses a pause prediction model to meet a user-defined
pause time target. It achieves smoother pause times than CMS at comparable 
throughput.</p>
<p>After G1 performs a global marking
phase determining the liveness of objects throughout the heap, it
will immediately know where in the heap there are regions that are
mostly empty. It will tackle those regions first, potentially
making a lot of space available. This way, the garbage collector
will obtain more breathing space, decreasing the probability of a
full GC. This is also why the garbage collector is called
Garbage-First. As its name suggests, G1 concentrates its collection
and compaction activity first on the areas of the heap that are
likely to be full of reclaimable objects, thus improving its
efficiency.</p>
<p>While most real-time collectors work at the highly granular
level of individual objects, G1 collects at the region level. If
any region contains no live objects it is immediately reclaimed.
The user can specify a goal for the pauses and G1 will do an
estimate of how many regions can be collected in that time based on
previous collections. So, the collector has a reasonably accurate
model of the cost of collecting the regions, and therefore "the
collector can choose a set of regions that can be collected within
a given pause time limit with high probability." In other words, G1
is not a hard real-time collector - it meets the soft real-time
goal with high probability but not absolute certainty. G1 attempts
to yield higher throughput in return for the softer, but still
moderately stringent, real-time constraints. This is a good fit for
large-scale server applications which often have large amounts of
live heap data and considerable thread-level parallelism. G1 also
provides some finer control, allowing a user to specify a fraction
of time during a period of execution to be spent on garbage
collection. For example, for every 250ms of execution spend no more
than 50ms on garbage collection.</p>
<p>G1 is planned to replace CMS in the Hotspot JVM. There are two
major differences between CMS and G1. The first is that G1 is a
compacting collector. G1 compacts sufficiently to completely avoid
the use of fine-grain free lists for allocation, which considerably
simplifies parts of the collector and mostly eliminates potential
fragmentation issues. As well as compacting, G1 offers more
predictable garbage collection pauses than the CMS collector and
allows users to set their desired pause targets.</p>
